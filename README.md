# Insurance Charges prediction based on demographics 


## Brief
This project uses demograhics details e.g. age,sex,bmi,# children,smoker,region information to predict the insurnace charges for the prospective customer. Various regression models i.e. Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, K-Nearest neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boost, Adaboost, XGBoost and CatBoost are evaluated and their MAE/R-Square metrics are calculated.

## Data
This project uses insurance dataset supplied with PyCaret. https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret/blob/master/README.md

The dataset contains both numerical and categorical predictors.

PyCaret is an open-source, low-code machine learning library in Python that automates machine learning workflows. It is an end-to-end machine learning and model management tool that speeds up the experiment cycle exponentially and makes you more productive. 

PyCaret is completely free and open-source and licensed under the [MIT](https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret/blob/master/LICENSE) license.


## Model 
A number of regression models i.e. Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, K-Nearest neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boost, Adaboost, XGBoost and CatBoost are evaluated and their MAE/R-Square metrics are calculated. 

## Hyperparameter Optimisation

## Results

Random Forest, Gradient Boost, XGBoost and CatBoost are giving good results and will be recommeded for similar analysis.
